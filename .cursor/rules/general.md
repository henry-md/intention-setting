# General Rules

- DO NOT create backwards compatability migrations in the project. Whiping the database is no big deal right now — this is a personal project. We want to avoid bloat. Absolutely NO need for backwards compatability.
- Do not tell me to check something in my codebase without checking it yourself first. To restate, because this is important, DO NOT give me an answer telling me to verify X about the codebase — you have the code in front of you, verify yourself! You may tell me what you found afterwards.
- If the question is asking for clarification specifically, it is ok to answer very simply. However if the question is more in the spirit of trying to learn things (as opposed to asking clarification for something I think I already know), do not be afriad to add as much context as you would like. Feel free to give short and long answers when appropriate.
